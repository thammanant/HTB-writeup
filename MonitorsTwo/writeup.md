# MonitorsTwo Writeup - by Thammanant Thamtaranon  

- MonitorsTwo is an easy Linux-based machine hosted on Hack The Box.

## Reconnaissance  
- I began with a full TCP port scan including service/version detection and OS fingerprinting:  `nmap -A -T4 -p- 10.10.11.214`

- The scan revealed two open ports:  
  - 22 (SSH)  
  - 80 (HTTP)
